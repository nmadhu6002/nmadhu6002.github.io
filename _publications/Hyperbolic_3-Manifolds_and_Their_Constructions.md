This is an expository paper I wrote at the end of the [Independent Research and Paper Writing](https://eulercircle.com/classes/independent-research-and-paper-writing/) (Summer Session 1, 2022) class at Euler Circle.

**Abstract** Hyperbolic geometry is one of the three main geometries also including Eu- clidean and elliptical geometries. In this paper we focus on hyperbolic 3-manifolds and explore the way we can construct them using convex polyhedra.
