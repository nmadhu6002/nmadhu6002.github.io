This is a video I created for the 2023 [Breakthrough Junior Challenge](https://breakthroughjuniorchallenge.org/). I talk Bell's Theorem which is a result that provides a way to test if the universe is truly probabalistic or if quantum mechanics is not complete, as proposed by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen. I wanted to create this video after I read about the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics and got interested in theories opposing quantum mechanics. I scored in the **top 10 percent of all vidoes** in the competition.
