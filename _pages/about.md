Hi! Iâ€™m Nandana, a freshman at Caltech planning to major in physics and electrical engineering.

My research interests lie at the intersection of physics and mathematics. In high schoool, I worked under [Dr. Padmini Rangamani](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/prangamani/home) and [Dr. Christopher Lee](https://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/ctlee/) at UCSD where I studied the dynamics of the cell membrane using mathematical modeling and computational tools. Some other areas I am interested in are physics-based simulations, differential geometry, and computational physics.

Outside of academics, I like watching and talking about movies, creating animations in Blender, and playing basketball. I also enjoy fiddling on the harmonica and knitting--especially when I need a creative break.
