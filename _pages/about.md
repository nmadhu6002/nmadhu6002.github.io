Hi! My name is Nandana and I am a freshman at Caltech. My major is currently undeclared, but I am hoping to study physics and electrical engineering.

My research interests lie at the intersection of physics and mathematics. While in high schoool, I worked under [Dr. Padmini Rangamani](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/prangamani/home) and [Dr. Christopher Lee](https://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/ctlee/) at UCSD where I studied the dynamics of the cell membrane. Some other areas I am also interested in are physics-based simulations, differential geometry, and computational physics.

For fun, I like watching and talking about movies, creating animations in Blender, playing basketball, and fiddling on the harmonica.
