This is a video I created for the 2021 Breakthrough Junior Challenge. I introduce the concept of entropy through a thought experiement called Maxwell's Demon. Entropy was a topic that I couldn't find a good description of so I created this video with visualizations to better understand this concept. I scored in the top 40 percent of all vidoes in the competition.
