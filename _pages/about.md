Hi! My name is Nandana and I am high school senior studying at [Canyon Crest Academy](https://cc.sduhsd.net/) in San Diego.

My research interests lie at the intersection of physics and mathematics. I am currently working under [Dr. Padmini Rangamani](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/prangamani/home) and [Dr. Christopher Lee](https://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/ctlee/) at UCSD where I am studying the dynamics of the cell membrane. Some other areas I am also interested in are physics-based simulations, differential geometry, and computational physics.

For fun, I like watching and talking about movies, creating animations in Blender, playing basketball, and the harmonica.
