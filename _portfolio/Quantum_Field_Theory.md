This is a video I created for the 2024 [Breakthrough Junior Challenge](https://breakthroughjuniorchallenge.org/). I talk Quantum Field Theory (QFT) which is a theory that combines special relativity and quantum mechanics. The unique thing about QFT is that it treats particles as merely disturbances in some universal field. I go more into depth about this idea and also the motivation for why this theory was developed in the video.
