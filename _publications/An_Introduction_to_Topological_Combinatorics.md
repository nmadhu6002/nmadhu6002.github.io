This is an expository paper I wrote at the end of the Combinatorics (Summer session 1, 2021) class at Euler Circle.

**Abstract** In this paper we go through a few application of topology in combinatorics. We will see how combinatorial problems can be elegantly solved using topological methods like the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem and Brouwerâ€™s Fixed Point Theorem.
