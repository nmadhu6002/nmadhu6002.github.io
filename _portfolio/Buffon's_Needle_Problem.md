This is a video I created for the 2022 [Breakthrough Junior Challenge](https://breakthroughjuniorchallenge.org/). I talk about Buffon's Needle Problem which is an interesting phenomenon where throwing needles on a series of lines can estimate pi. I give an intutitive and simple explanation for why this is the case in the video. I scored in the **top 30 percent of all vidoes** in the competition.
