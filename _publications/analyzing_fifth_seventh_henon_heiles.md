**Abstract** In 1962, astronomers Michel Hénon and Carl Heiles studied orbits of stars around centers of galaxies to determine the third integral of motion in galactic dynamics. In order to do this, they reduced the system down to a 2-dimensional axisymmetric Hamiltonian system. Now this is known as the Hénon-Heiles (HH) System. Due to its apparent simplicity but extremely complicated dynamical behavior, this system is currently a paradigm in dynamical systems.

In this paper, we perform a series expansion up to the seventh order of a potential with axial and reflection symmetries. After some transformations, this turns into the generalized Hénon-Heiles (GHH) system where we separate the fifth and seventh-order terms. We qualitatively analyze this system for energies near the threshold between bounded and unbounded motion with Poincaré sections and quantitatively analyze with Lyapunov Exponents. We find that particles far from the critical energy demonstrate less chaos. Additionally, the fifth-order term creates more regularity while the seventh-order term does the opposite.
